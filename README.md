# Restful Sleep Tracker group project using React Native

## Background:
- Participated in a group project during second year university as part of the 'Professional Development' module.
- Created a React Native mobile application using Expo to develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps.

## Project goal
As part of our research to create the best sleep tracker for our users and prospective stakeholders, we conducted research based on online articles, existing sleep apps, app reviews and questionnaires to set a strong foundation for the requirements and design of our mobile app. The main objective of the mobile app is to help users track their sleep cycle and improve their sleep quality. 

## Implementation:
- Navigation: In terms of the implementation there is a navigation hierarchy in which one navigator is nested inside another
one. The root navigator used is a drawer navigator. The drawer navigator points towards a tab
navigator which controls the bottom tab navigation, and each tab contains a stack navigator. 
- Screens: home, sleep goal, activity tracker, graph screen, splash screen, diary, calender, login and sign up screens.
- Database stored in 'users.json' - which records all the user registrations in a json format for the application.
